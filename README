This is a project to help developers work on the Kazoo platform: https://www.github.com/2600hz/kazoo

The idea is to containerize the infrastructure required to develop against the erlang kazoo code base (and also the monster-ui javascript codebase).

There is a runonce.sh that should be run once after a docker-compose up; this will complete the couchdb setup, set some kazoo defaults, and create the first account and user.
